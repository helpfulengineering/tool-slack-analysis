Most activity occurs on other channels. Feel free to browse and join channels to find something you are interested in working on. When you join a new channel, you can find initial instructions in the channel topics and :pushpin: pinned messages. Channel leaders will be able to answer specific questions about a channel. Take initiative, ask around, and help out / organize where you see fit.

_Pro-tip: Start your search with “#project-” to see all the on-going projects. “#skill-” let’s you join channels with people of a particular skill set. “#discussion-” shows all the various discussions - they’re a great source of information._

If you have any further questions about getting started, please reply to this thread and myself or another moderator :moderator:  will be glad to assist.
